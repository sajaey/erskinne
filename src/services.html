             <p>The customer life cycle depicts the stages that a customer experiences when examining,
              purchasing and using a product or service. An understanding of the optimal behaviours and
              experiences at each stage can profoundly enhance performance.</p>
              <p>For example, during the pre-sales phase it is vital to understand which factors will drive
                customers to develop a buying interest. Interest could be generated through Events,
                Marketing, Direct Marketing (field sales, telephonic sales, e-mailers), Advertising, Lead
                Generation, and Database Management. In the sales phase a clearly defined process, enacted
                by competent sales staff, will ensure a successful sales transaction and build the basis for
                sustainable customer relations. In order to stimulate a re-purchase, throughout the after-sales
                phase the focus should be on factors likely to promote customer loyalty, such as regular
                interaction with the customer and professional customer assistance. Each phase can be
                optimised in terms of effectiveness, profitability and customer orientation.</p>

            <p>The term ‘touchpoint’ describes a singular interaction by the customer with a product, service or
              brand. These numerous key-interactions can be direct, such as campaigns or sales consultations,
              or indirect, such as word-of-mouth recommendations.</p>
              <p>Analysis and assessment of each touchpoint reveals the experience from the customer’s point of
                view, enabling the company to adapt to their needs. If touchpoint analysis is appropriately
                planned and executed for each customer segment, it aids the development of a coherent
                customer experience and increases the efficiency and effectiveness of all co-ordinated
